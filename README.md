# Simple Universal Boilerplate of [Redux-First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router)


![redux-first-router-demo screenshot](./screenshot.png)
> For a demo/boilerplate that goes even farther make sure to check out the **["DEMO"](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-demo)**. A lot more features and use-cases are covered there, but this *boilerplate* is the best place to start to learn the basics of RFR, especially if you're new to any of these things: SSR, Code Splitting, Express, APIs, Webpack and Redux in general.


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-boilerplate
cd redux-first-router-boilerplate
yarn
yarn start
```


## Files You Should Look At:

*client code:*
- [***src/configureStore.js***](./src/configureStore.js)
- [***src/routesMap.js***](./src/routesMap.js) - ***(the primary work of RFR)***
- [***src/components/Switcher.js***](./src/components/Switcher.js) - *(universal component concept)*
- [***src/components/Sidebar.js***](./src/components/Sidebar.js) - *(look at the different ways to link + dispatch URL-aware actions)*


*server code:*
- [***server/index.js***](./server/index.js)
- [***server/render.js***](./server/render.js) - *(super simple thanks to [webpack-flush-chunks](https://github.com/faceyspacey/webpack-flush-chunks) from our ***"Universal"*** product line)*
- [***server/configureStore.js***](./server/configureStore.js) - ***(observe how the matched route's thunk is awaited on)***

## Warning about Unicode

It's worth checking your JSON for unicode, especially if you are constantly seeing red screens of death after refreshing the browser. Unicode will break the initial state object loaded into the dom by the server rendering.
